Do not start, stop, or change the dosage of any medicines without your doctor's approval. Warfarin interacts with many prescription, nonprescription, vitamin, and herbal products. This includes medications that are applied to the skin or inside the vagina or rectum. The interactions with warfarin usually result in an increase or decrease in the ""blood-thinning"" (anticoagulant) effect. Your doctor or other health care professional should closely monitor you to prevent serious bleeding or clotting problems. While taking warfarin, it is very important to tell your doctor or pharmacist of any changes in medications, vitamins, or herbal products that you are taking. Some products that may interact with this drug include: capecitabine, imatinib, mifepristone. Aspirin, aspirin-like drugs (salicylates), and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs such as ibuprofen, naproxen, celecoxib) may have effects similar to warfarin. These drugs may increase the risk of bleeding problems if taken during treatment with warfarin. Carefully check all prescription/nonprescription product labels (including drugs applied to the skin such as pain-relieving creams) since the products may contain NSAIDs or salicylates. Talk to your doctor about using a different medication (such as acetaminophen) to treat pain/fever. Low-dose aspirin and related drugs (such as clopidogrel, ticlopidine) should be continued if prescribed by your doctor for specific medical reasons such as heart attack or stroke prevention. Consult your doctor or pharmacist for more details. Many herbal products interact with warfarin. Tell your doctor before taking any herbal products, especially bromelains, coenzyme Q10, danshen, dong quai, fenugreek, garlic, ginkgo biloba, ginseng, and St. John's wort, among others.

Conditions that increase your risk of developing blood clots include a certain type of irregular  heart  rhythm ( atrial fibrillation ),  heart  valve replacement, recent  heart attack , and certain surgeries (such as hip/ knee replacement ).

If you have not been eating well, if you have an illness or infection that causes fever, vomiting, or diarrhea for more than 2 days, or if you start using any antibiotic medications, contact your doctor or pharmacist right away because these conditions can affect how warfarin works. This medication can cause heavy bleeding. To lower the chance of getting cut, bruised, or injured, use great caution with sharp objects like safety razors and nail cutters. Use an electric razor when shaving and a soft toothbrush when brushing your teeth. Avoid activities such as contact sports. If you fall or injure yourself, especially if you hit your head, call your doctor right away. Your doctor may need to check you. The Food & Drug Administration has stated that generic warfarin products are interchangeable. However, consult your doctor or pharmacist before switching warfarin products.

Preventing harmful blood clots helps to reduce the risk of a  stroke  or  heart attack . Conditions that increase your risk of developing blood clots include a certain type of irregular  heart  rhythm ( atrial fibrillation ),  heart  valve replacement, recent  heart attack , and certain surgeries (such as hip/ knee replacement ). Warfarin is commonly called a "" blood thinner ,"" but the more correct term is ""anticoagulant."" It helps to keep  blood  flowing smoothly in your body by decreasing the amount of certain substances (clotting proteins) in your  blood .",,,"Before taking warfarin, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are allergic to it; or if you have any other allergies. This product may contain inactive ingredients, which can cause allergic reactions or other problems. Talk to your pharmacist for more details.

It is important that all your doctors and dentists know that you take warfarin. Before having surgery or any medical/dental procedures, tell your doctor or dentist that you are taking this medication and about all the products you use (including prescription drugs, nonprescription drugs, and herbal products).

If you have not been eating well, if you have an illness or infection that causes fever, vomiting, or diarrhea for more than 2 days, or if you start using any antibiotic medications, contact your doctor or pharmacist right away because these conditions can affect how warfarin works. This medication can cause heavy bleeding. To lower the chance of getting cut, bruised, or injured, use great caution with sharp objects like safety razors and nail cutters. Use an electric razor when shaving and a soft toothbrush when brushing your teeth. Avoid activities such as contact sports. If you fall or injure yourself, especially if you hit your head, call your doctor right away. Your doctor may need to check you. The Food & Drug Administration has stated that generic warfarin products are interchangeable. However, consult your doctor or pharmacist before switching warfarin products. Be careful not to take more than one medication that contains warfarin unless specifically directed by the doctor or health care provider who is monitoring your warfarin treatment.

If you become pregnant or think you may be pregnant, tell your doctor right away. If you are planning pregnancy, discuss a plan for managing your condition with your doctor before you become pregnant. Your doctor may switch the type of medication you use during pregnancy.
